# findr - a prototype telescope finder

**⚠️ Warning: This project is a work in progress and a prototype. It is not fully functional or robust and should not be used in production environments. ⚠️**

This project provides a web-based interface to control a Raspberry Pi camera remotely. It runs a Flask web server on the Pi, allowing you to view a live stream and adjust camera settings from any web browser on the same network.

**⚠️ When I first started developing this, I noticed that there was a 
substantial amount of noise, which took the appearance of many horizontal lines
in the captured imagery, especially when the gain was set to be values greater
than one.   A bit of digging around revealed that it was likely caused
by power supply noise on the 3.3v rail, but that there was an option I could
add to `/boot/firmware/config.txt` that would fix it, and for once, it 
actually did work.  You probably want to add this line to `/boot/config.txt':

```
power_force_3v3_pwm=1
```

## Features

- **Web-Based Interface:** Control your camera from a simple web page.
- **Live Video Stream:** View a real-time MJPEG stream from the camera.
- **Camera Controls:** Adjust settings like gain, exposure, and white balance.
- **Headless Operation:** Runs on a Raspberry Pi without a monitor or keyboard.
- **Development Mode:** Includes a dummy camera interface for development on non-Pi machines.

## Installation and Usage

There are two ways to run this project: on a development machine (like a laptop) or on a Raspberry Pi.

### On a Development Machine (Non-Pi)

This setup uses a dummy camera feed, allowing you to work on the web interface without a Raspberry Pi.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to see the interface with the dummy camera feed.

### On a Raspberry Pi

This setup uses the actual Raspberry Pi camera.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install the `picamera2` library:**
    ```bash
    pip install picamera2
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

6.  Find your Raspberry Pi's IP address (e.g., by running `hostname -I`) and open a web browser on another device on the same network. Go to `http://<your-pi-ip-address>:8080`.
